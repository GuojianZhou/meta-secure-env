Signed RPMs(GPG) Feature
========================

RPM supports GPG signatures to retain the integrity of the RPM. Once signed,
the systems with the corresponding public key imported can verify that no
modifications occurred after the data was signed. This feature enables
customer signed-rpm(GPG) support. It imports the customer's public key into
the systems that uses the repo. In the meantime it marks the auto-signed
packages' as untrusted.

By default a Pulsar public key is provided so that user will trust repos from
official Pulsar releases. If customer want to use their own key and
maintaining their own repo, there are two way to achieve this:

1. Directly replace the public key files/rpm_public_key/pub.key
   NOTE: be sure to use the exact same name so that the build system can find
it.

2. Redefine RPM_PUBLIB_KEY in the template.conf
